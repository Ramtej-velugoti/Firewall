🔥 Basic Firewall Project
This repository contains my attempt at developing a firewall. The goal of this project is to create a functional firewall capable of filtering network traffic based on predefined rules.

📌 Project Overview
📁 src/main.cpp: The main source code file for the firewall program.
📄 docs/info.md: Explains the code structure and troubleshooting tips.
📝 README.md: Comprehensive documentation of the project.
🛠️ Development Environment
To develop and run this firewall project, you will need:

🖥️ Operating System: Windows 10/11 or Linux/GNU-based system (Ubuntu Recommended).
🔧 Compiler: Any Windows C++ compiler or Linux/GNU compiler (e.g., GCC).
🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the firewall project:

🔀 Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/firewall.git
🛠️ Set up the environment:

Ensure your development environment is ready (e.g., MSYS with GCC).
🖥️ Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/firewall
📋 Review predefined rules:

Open the rules.txt file to understand the traffic filtering rules.
🔨 Build the firewall program:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o firewall main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto
▶️ Run the compiled firewall program:

For Windows-based OS:

bash
Copy code
./firewall.exe
For Linux-based OS:

bash
Copy code
./firewall
🔬 Test the firewall:

Send network traffic and observe the filtering based on the predefined rules.
